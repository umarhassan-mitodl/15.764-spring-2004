This term's special topic, \"Customer-Driven Operations,\" considers how a number of companies have succeeded in focusing their operation systems on the customer. The class reviews the quantitative models and theoretical tools underlying some of the customer-driven operational practices of these cutting-edge companies. Students will read and present research papers on topics such as distribution systems, short life-cycle product management, and forecast evolution models.\n\nThis MIT OpenCourseWare site is dedicated to the memory of Bhuwan Singh, a member of the class.\n",
